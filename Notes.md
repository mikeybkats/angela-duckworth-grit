# Chapter 3

## Effort Counts Twice

p35

- author bemoans that any noteworthy accomplishment is praised as coming from such a "Talented" person
- "if we overemphasize talent, we underemphasize everything else"
- it makes people think `talent --> acheivement`
- there is an unconscious bias toward talent

p38

- in the case of swimmers, Dan Chamblis, says that "Greatness is many individual feats, all of them doable." The implication is doable by anyone.
- high level performance is an accretion of mundane acts

p39

- Nietzsche - "with everything perfect, we do not ask how it came to be"
- Nietzsche - "Our vanity, our self love, promotes the cult of genious"
- By calling someone genius is to call them beyond human, something magical. Unexplainable. Doing this puts us in a mode where we become incapable of comparing ourselves with the magical person (we will always see ourselves as being inadequate in comparrison).
- The above is a mythologizing of talent that lets us foregive our own lack of greatness rather than try to achieve the something greater.
- Nietsche implores us all to become craftsmen and acquire genius through seriousness of workmanship
-

p41

- A theory - a theory is an incomplete idea, but it takes what (little data) we have and makes some kind of sense of it in an overly simple way.
- `talent * effort = skill --> skill * effort = achievement`
- "effort makes skill productive"

p44

- MacKenzie the potter produced more and more pots in a day `talent * effort = skill`. Only some out of the ones he produced were good ones.
- MacKenzie the potter over time produced more good pots in a day `skill * effort = achievement`

p45

- John Irving the author spends more time re-reading and re-writing his own work in order to perfect it.

p47

- Runtime on a treadmill is a surprising predictor of psychological adjustment throughout adulthood according to a harvard test conducted of a series of decades.
- effort keeps you on the treadmill longer, not physical fitness

p49

- staying on the treadmill the longest is certainly a feat.
- The true indicator of grit is going back to the treadmill eager to try again the next day.

p50

- if the formula at the top of chapter 3 is correct:
- someone who is twice as talented but half as hardworking as another person might reach the same level of skill but still produce dramatically less over time.
- Strivers improve in skill and quantity of that skill.

p51

- with effort talent becomes skill
- effort makes skill into something productive

# Chapter 4

## How gritty are you?

p54

- "grit isn't just working hard, that's only part of it. there are no shortcuts to excellence."
- grit is about staying with something that you're willing to be loyal to it for a very long time.

p56

- grit has two components passion and perserverence

p59 - 60

- Passion is a compass - look at the example of Jeff Gettlemen pulitzer prize winning journalist who never really knew exactly what he wanted, dispite being a great student (attending oxford university), a great photographer and a great writer. However his passion worked like a compass. Eventually because he kept tinkering and building on what he had already learned it lead him to his ultimate role as journalist and African Bureau chief for the New York Times.
