# Chapter 3
## Effort Counts Twice

p35 
- author bemoans that any noteworthy accomplishment is praised as coming from such a "Talented" person
- "if we overemphasize talent, we underemphasize everything else"
- it makes people think `talent --> acheivement`
- there is an unconscious bias toward talent

p38
- in the case of swimmers, Dan Chamblis, says that "Greatness is many individual feats, all of them doable." The implication is doable by anyone.
- high level performance is an accretion of mundane acts

p39 
- Nietzsche - "with everything perfect, we do not ask how it came to be"
- Nietzsche - "Our vanity, our self love, promotes the cult of genious"
- By calling someone genius is to call them beyond human, something magical. Unexplainable. Doing this puts us in a mode where we become incapable of comparing ourselves with the magical person (we will always see ourselves as being inadequate in comparrison). 
- The above is a mythologizing of talent that lets us foregive our own lack of greatness rather than try to achieve the something greater.
- Nietsche implores us all to become craftsmen and acquire genius through seriousness of workmanship
- 

p41
- A theory - a theory is an incomplete idea, but it takes what (little data) we have and makes some kind of sense of it in an overly simple way.
- `talent * effort = skill --> skill * effort = achievement` 
- "effort makes skill productive"

p45
- John Irving the author spends more time re-reading and re-writing his own work in order to perfect it.
