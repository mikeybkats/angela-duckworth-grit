# Chapter 3

## Effort Counts Twice

p35

- author bemoans that any noteworthy accomplishment is praised as coming from such a "Talented" person
- "if we overemphasize talent, we underemphasize everything else"
- it makes people think `talent --> acheivement`
- there is an unconscious bias toward talent

p38

- in the case of swimmers, Dan Chamblis, says that "Greatness is many individual feats, all of them doable." The implication is doable by anyone.
- high level performance is an accretion of mundane acts

p39

- Nietzsche - "with everything perfect, we do not ask how it came to be"
- Nietzsche - "Our vanity, our self love, promotes the cult of genius"
- By calling someone genius is to call them beyond human, something magical. Unexplainable. Doing this puts us in a mode where we become incapable of comparing ourselves with the magical person (we will always see ourselves as being inadequate in comparison).
- The above is a mythologizing of talent that lets us forgive our own lack of greatness rather than try to achieve the something greater.
- Nietzsche implores us all to become craftsmen and acquire genius through seriousness of workmanship
-

p41

- A theory - a theory is an incomplete idea, but it takes what (little data) we have and makes some kind of sense of it in an overly simple way.
- `talent * effort = skill --> skill * effort = achievement`
- "effort makes skill productive"

p44

- MacKenzie the potter produced more and more pots in a day `talent * effort = skill`. Only some out of the ones he produced were good ones.
- MacKenzie the potter over time produced more good pots in a day `skill * effort = achievement`

p45

- John Irving the author spends more time re-reading and re-writing his own work in order to perfect it.

p47

- Runtime on a treadmill is a surprising predictor of psychological adjustment throughout adulthood according to a harvard test conducted of a series of decades.
- effort keeps you on the treadmill longer, not physical fitness

p49

- staying on the treadmill the longest is certainly a feat.
- The true indicator of grit is going back to the treadmill eager to try again the next day.

p50

- if the formula at the top of chapter 3 is correct:
- someone who is twice as talented but half as hardworking as another person might reach the same level of skill but still produce dramatically less over time.
- Strivers improve in skill and quantity of that skill.

p51

- with effort talent becomes skill
- effort makes skill into something productive

# Chapter 4

## How gritty are you?

p54

- "grit isn't just working hard, that's only part of it. there are no shortcuts to excellence."
- grit is about staying with something that you're willing to be loyal to it for a very long time.

p56

- grit has two components passion and perserverence

p59 - 60

- Passion is a compass - look at the example of Jeff Gettlemen pulitzer prize winning journalist who never really knew exactly what he wanted, dispite being a great student (attending oxford university), a great photographer and a great writer. However his passion worked like a compass. Eventually because he kept tinkering and building on what he had already learned it lead him to his ultimate role as journalist and African Bureau chief for the New York Times.

p61

- do you have a life philosophy? ie "This is what I want" Some people have no problem answering this.
- Pete Carroll, head coach of the Seahawks realized he didn't have a life philosophy after being between coaching jobs.
- his? "Do things better than they have been done before"

p62 - p63

- John Wooden (legendary UCLA basketball coach) said that "figuring out the overarching vision is of the utmost importance"
- Envision goals in a hierarchy:

_goal hierarchy:_

```
                Goal                 Top Level - 'The ultimate concern' - Even more abstract and more important.
                 |
        Goal_____|_____Goal          Mid Level - More abstract, more important
        |                |
  Goal__|__Goal    Goal__|__Goal     Low Level - Most concrete and specific goals. Merely a means to an ends
```

p63

- Make everyday choices based around you singular goal or ultimate concern.
- Hall of fame baseball pitcher, Tom Seaver, restructured many very basic aspects of his life (petting dogs with non pitching hand, using non pitching hand in trivially harmful situations, shaping his diet to be more healthy ect) all in order to be a better baseball pitcher.

p64

- _Positive Fantasizing_ is when you have an ultimate concern, but you cannot formulate the smaller goals that get you on the track to reaching that ultimate concern.
- indulging in these fantasies without considering the obstacles are in the way has short term payoffs but long term costs.
- in the short term, not meeting or considering the obstacles will make someone feel good about their aspirations but regret and disappointment later in life when they have failed to reach their goals.
- _Goal conflict_ is when there are multiple competing concerns. This makes it harder to achieve the larger vision of each goal.
- having some competing goals is necessary. For instance there may be a goal hierarchy for being a parent and a professional goal hierarchy.

p66

- Warren Buffett asks his pilot, "don't you have bigger goals than just to fly him around to where he needs to go?"
- Buffett's tip:
  - write down a list of 25 career goals
  - do some soul searching
  - circle only five of them - the highest priority goals
  - avoid the others at all cost. They are the distractions
- like below:

| name of goal   | level of importance (scale from 1-10) | circled? |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| cabinet system | 8                                     | X        |

- if the goals are interrelated, it may not be feasible to circle only five.
- if you have to divide your time between different career goals then you will be in conflict.
- There needs to be one internal compass leading you

p67

- Angela Duckworth adds a step to Buffett's tip: _Ask yourself to what extend do the goals serve a common purpose?_

p74

- Bob Mankoff new yorker cartoonist made getting rejected a sport and faced year over year rejections before finally getting his cartoons published.

p75

- IQ doesn't seem to matter so much when determining the most from the least accomplished people.
- in other words in terms of IQ Sir Isaac Newton was indistinguishable from other lesser known geniuses that accomplished nothing exceedingly memorable.

# chapter 5

## Grit Grows

p79

- is grit more like your height (genetic) or more like the language you speak (learned from experience)?

p80

- (from above) just like most traits, it's a bit of both.

p84

- the previous pages 80 - 83 mostly illustrate how advancement is a function of environmental advancement and nurture. and gives several examples of generational changes that have occured for the better
- Flynn, an academic psychologist calls the "virtuous cycle of skill improvement the social multiplier effect"
- "Small environmental differences or genetic ones can trigger a virtuous cycle"

p85

- so far according to data, previous generations like the greatest generation look to be grittier than todays younger generations.

p86

- it's possible that the generational data showing older people being grittier has more to do with age than with what generation you're from.
- "the maturity principle" - in short we grow up (most of us)
-

p87

- being a promising beginner is fun, but being an actual expert is more gratifying.
- we change when we need to. necessity is the mother of invention and adaptation.

p88 - 89

- "the maturity principle"
- going from diapers to potty training instantaneously (almost). Angela Duckworth's daughter refused to go in the potty until all her classmates in the next grade were (age three)
- Bernie Noe of Lakeside school (in Seattle) daughter was perpetually late for everything until she got her first job, and the manager told her that if she was ever late she would be fired on the spot.
- "lectures don't have the same effect as consequences"

p89

- two truths (probably):
- people do get grittier as the age
- people from other generations may have had to have been more gritty.

p89-90

- how does grit grow in a person?
- the best place to start is to look at where you are now and ask yourself why
- the higher the level of goal the more you will stick with it if you are a true paragon of grit

p91 - 92

- There are some psychological assets / aspects to having grit:
  - interest - you must be totally absorbed by the goal
  - practice - do "it" everyday and focus on re-evaluating and improving day in and day out
  - purpose - purpose makes your interest into a passion
  - hope - perseverance that sticks with you along the way
- the above are all learned traits - that is not exclusively born into.

# Part II: Growing grit from inside out

---

# Chapter 6

## Interest

p95-97

- do you do what you love? or what is practical?
- people are more satisfied when they do something that matches their personal interests.
- people perform better when they do something they enjoy
-

p99

- matching your job to what captures your attention is a good idea

p100

- not everyone will take a bite of their proverbial sole meuniére and wake up to their passion like Julia Child did.
- Julia admits in her biography that after that meal there was a series of other experiences that played a role in her journey.
- it took Julia 40 years to find her true passion
- Indeed, it can take years to find a passion according to many grit paragons
-

p102

- There is a mythology that a passion comes sudden and swift - career, love or otherwise.
- According to Barry Schwartz of Swarthmore college, exhilarations of a particular subject often only come when sticking with it for the long haul. Only then do the subtleties and nuances start to become truly interesting.
- Meeting a potential match (a promising one) is just the very beginning.

p103

- we don't know much about the psychology of interest.
- why is one subject interesting to one person and not so to another?
- "passion for your work is a little bit discovery"

p104

- interests can't be forced onto yourself
- According to Jeff Bezos it's a mistake that people often make.
- interests come only through interaction with the outside world
-

p106

- people often "stink" at the things they're interested in.
- however, they usually "stink" more at things they are not interested in.

p107

- even the most accomplished top level people start out as unserious beginners.
- one of the keys to nurturing an interest is an early mentor who makes the activity fun - like a game
- the flame of interest can be smothered by overbearing parents.

p108

- experts and beginners have different motivational needs
- at the start beginners need encouragement and freedom

p110 - 112

- cute stories about how Jeff Bezos' mother nurtured his curiosity and inventiveness without freaking out.

p112

- "short termers" are people that don't ever settle down in a single career path often switching jobs every three to five years.
- paragons of grit learn to deepen their interest in something as time goes by

p112-113

- humans have a base need to learn and grow starting from the time we are babies
- why then does grit exist at all? once something is learned why do we desire to get better at it and invest more time into it?
- why is it so normal to say something like "the more i know, the less i understand?"
- Paul Silvia, a leading authority on the emotion of interest, says that "novelty for the beginner comes in one form, and novelty for the expert comes in another"
- modern or abstract art may all look the same to a non expert, but to an expert has enourmous understanding and sensitivity that the rest of us don't have.

p113

- How do you foster an interest if you don't have one? Ask these questions:
  - what do I like to think about?
  - where does my mind wander?
  - what do I really care about?
  - how do I enjoy spending my time?
  - what do I find unbearable?
- How to solve a crossword puzzle:
  - begin with the answers you're the surest of and build from there
  - don't be afraid to guess
  - don't be afraid to erase an answer that's not working
- If you already know what you like, then the next phase is _development_

p114

- The development of interests takes time. Interests must be engaged with over and over again for the interest to develop

# Chapter 7

## Practice

p118

- Some people get twenty years of experience... others get one year of experience twenty times.
- _kaizen_ is Japanese for resisting arrested development. it's the same as continuous improvement.
- a big part of _kaizen_ is a non complacence with the status quo. The desire to look forward and wanting to grow.
- _quality of time_ means that the time on task is better time on task. Efficiency.
-

p119

- as you get better at something your rate of improvement slows.
-

p120

- it takes 10 years or 10,000 hours to get good at something and be an expert
- but, it takes 10 years along with deliberate practice to actually get to the expert level
-

p121

- _Deliberate Practice: How to practice_
  - set a target that is measurable and beyond the typical result
  - narrow the practice to a focus an area of weakness
  - practice until the stretch goal is reached
  - take notice of the parts of the practice that were done wrong so they can be recognized and fixed in later practices
  - make a new stretch goal and start again

p123

- Benjamin Franklin practiced and drilled himself repeatedly to become a better writer. He took his favorite essays and writings and put them in his desk drawer. Then wrote and rewrote the essays from memory and compared them to the originals. He corrected and took note of any mistakes. Then he did it over again. He also practiced by translating poetry into prose and back to poetry again.

p124

- _Deliberate practice_ helps shine a light on the things you think you know but don't actually know.

p126 - p127

- when improving a skill, deliberate practice has no rival
- when it comes to feeling though, deliberate practice is painful and not enjoyable.
- Some professional atheletes even describe deliberate practice as extremely intense terms.
  - "complete frustrations"
  - "little deaths"

p129

- the other side of deliberate practice is a state called "flow"
- flow is when you work within your defined boundaries of excellence, it feels as if it happens almost automatically to the practitioner. (Think figure skater or orator or musician going through their performance)

p133

- grittier people have the quality of not just enduring deliberate practice more, but actually enjoy deliberate practice more than other people.
- somewhere along the way they learned to not be put down by the pain and enjoy the little wins of deliberate practice

p135

- top performers remind us that deliberate practice need not be so painful, and also that a more true pain is repeating the cycle of making the same mistakes over and over again without ever improving. (I agree)

p136

- grittier spellers who logged more hours (from the spelling bee data group) said that deliberate practice was both more effortful and more enjoyable

p138

- you can be super motivated and hardworking and not be doing deliberate practice. it's easy to not see it sometimes while practicing

p139

- in order to do grittier practices, focus on establishing the routines.
- Do the practice at the same time, in the same place, in the same deliberate way.

p140

- to get the most out of deliberate practice change the way you experience it.
- embrace the challenge rather than fear it

p141

- children learn from a young age about shame, fear, and embarresment. They are learned behaviors that parents instill in their children when they make mistakes.

# Chapter 8

## Purpose

p143 - 144

- sources of passion:
  - interest
  - purpose
- both are at the core of the behaviors of gritty people
- three phase progression of passion:
  1. start out with a self oriented interest
  1. learn self disciplined practice
  1. integrate the work with an other centered purpose

p144

- Psyhologist Benjamin Bloom's research into world class professionals resulted in three periods in their journey of expertise:
  1. early years - Chapter 6
  1. middle years - Chapter 7
  1. later years - Chapter 8

p145 - 146

- At the core, purpose for paragons of grit comes down to the belief that what they do matters to other people beyond themselves.
- According to Angela Duckworth, to grit paragons _purpose_ means the intention to contribute to the well being of others
- Aristotle categorized the pursuit of happiness into two categories:
  1. _eudaimonic_ - in step with the inner good spirit
  1. _hedonic_ - in step with the self-centered enjoyment

p147

- we have evolved so that both self centered behaviors and the desire to seek meaning drive us all to survive.
- in other words, pleasure and purpose go hand in hand, and grity people are the same in terms of pleasure and purpose as anyone else.

p148

- for most people purpose is a powerful motivator

p149

- some people like Hitler or Stalin may have believed what they were doing was for the benefit of the majority and therefore for the greater good
- there are gritty villains, but there are more gritty heros than gritty villains
- The parable of bricklayers (always loved this one). The bricklayers are asked what they are doing
  - The first bicklayer says "I'm laying bricks"
  - The second says, "I'm building a church"
  - The third, pauses, looks up to the sky and back again to the many and says, "I'm building a house of God"
- which of the three bricklayers are you? Is it a _job_, _a career_ or _a calling_?

p150 - 152

- people who have a purpose are more likely to be gritty. People that don't have a purpose are likely not going to be paragons of grit.
- most people don't have a purpose
- many people are looking for a purpose
- that that have found a purpose are the rarity.
- purpose (the believe that you are doing important work) will keep you happier in your work even if it's unglamorous or lower pay

p153

- one mistake commonly made when looking for purpose is that people tend to search for their calling rather than deepen their interest to develop their calling
- the Bricklayer who says that they are just "laying bricks" one day will become the bricklayer who says, "I am building a house of God"

p154

- Michael Baime a doctor at Upenn didn't really want to become a doctor. He didn't feel like it was his calling. His true passion was meditation. Eventually, after years of pracicing medicine (and enjoying the help he was providing to people) started teaching his fellow doctors and nurses and patients about meditation. This was his calling.

p159

- self oriented and other oriented motivations are not opposites. They are independent entities. You can have both, either or neither. You can be a business tycoon and driven to help others.

p160

- people that have pro-social and personal goals intertwined are more successful

p162

- "a beyond the self" orientation can be deliberately cultivated.
- According to Standford Psychologist Bill Damon, purpose is the answer the the why question: What am I doing this?
- Origins of purpose (as a young person):
  1. The Spark: Find an interest
  1. The Role Model: encounter a role model that demonstrates accomplishment on behalf of others
  1. The Revelation: A problem is discovered in the world that needs solving
  1. The Belief: That you can personally make a difference

p167

- _job crafting_ how can you craft your own job so it's more attuned with your core values.
- find inspiration in a purposeful role model
- imagine yourself in 15 years – what will be important to you then?

# chapter 9

## Hope

p169

- grit rests on the hope that we can shape tomorrow to be better through our own efforts

p172

- suffering you can't control is what leads you to hopelessness. See electric shock experiment on caged dogs (sounds horrible) p171-172

p173

- "suffering without control reliably produces symptoms of clinical depression"

p176 - p178

- hypothesis: teachers who have an optimistic view of adversity have more grit than their pessimistic counterparts
- after a year long experiment looking assessing teachers optimism and happiness. They found that more optimistic teachers were both grittier and happier.
- the data shows that teachers who keep trying to find new ways to reach and teach their students for the better have a better chance of finding them. when you stop searching, it likely means the teach has given up hope that they can be found.
- Henry Ford, "whether you think you can, or think you can't – you're right"

p178

- why are some people pessimists and some optimists?
- why do some people fail at confronting failure
- _success only program_ - success praise given when a child had done well or not
- _attribution retraining program_ - success praise was not given, and instead the child was told that they hadn't solved enough problems and that they should have tried harder
- children in the _attribution retraining program_ learned to interpret failure as a cue that they should try harder rather than confirmation that they did not have what was required to succeed

p180

- what is a growth mindset?
- do you view your intelligence can change? or, that it's a fixed asset that does not change?
- a fixed mindset (believing talent is fixed), becomes a liability when you reach a challenge that you can't easily overcome. If you think your intelligence is fixed, then you will possibly fall into the trap that you can't go any further.
- _people with a growth mindset are grittier than people with a fixed mindset._

p181

- Praising effort rather than outcomes or natural talent promotes a growth mindset.
- the goal with Knowledge is Power Program is to instill values in children that life is more about challenging yourself and learning to do what you couldn't than reaching specific outcomes.

| undermines growth mindset                         | promotes growth mindset                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "you're a natural, i love that"                   | "you're a learner, i love that"                                                            |
| "well, at least you tried"                        | "that didn't work. let's talk about why and how to make it better"                         |
| "you're so talented, great job"                   | "great job, what's one thing that could be improved on?"                                   |
| "this is hard. don't feel bad if you can't do it" | "this is hard don't feel bad if you can't do it yet. you will learn if you keep trying"    |
| "maybe this just isn't your strength"             | "i have high standards, i'm holding you to them because I know we can reach them together" |

p182

- language may help demonstrate / cultivate hope. but actions are a stronger method for modeling growth mindset
- James Baldwin, "children have never been good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them"

p184

- the link between behavioral therapy and learned helplessness leads to resilience training
- most people have an inner fixed mindset (even when we try to have a growth mindset)
- it's easy to change what we say without changing our body language or actual opinions
- What to do?
  - watch for mismatches between words and actions.
  - acknowledge when you slip up
  - give a name to your inner fixed mindset characters:
    - watch for a specific behavior, make note of it, give that personality a character name
- adopting grit perspective requires getting better at things

p192

### growth mindset --> optimistic self-talk --> perseverance over adversity

- what can I do to boost this one?
- we maintain the ability to grow myelin throughout adulthood (the insulation that protects neurons).

p195

- everybody needs a champion to tell them to keep going. someone that inspires hope. a mentor too.

# Chapter 10

## Parenting for Grit

p199 - 201

- how do you nurture grit?
