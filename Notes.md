# Chapter 3

## Effort Counts Twice

p35

- author bemoans that any noteworthy accomplishment is praised as coming from such a "Talented" person
- "if we overemphasize talent, we underemphasize everything else"
- it makes people think `talent --> acheivement`
- there is an unconscious bias toward talent

p38

- in the case of swimmers, Dan Chamblis, says that "Greatness is many individual feats, all of them doable." The implication is doable by anyone.
- high level performance is an accretion of mundane acts

p39

- Nietzsche - "with everything perfect, we do not ask how it came to be"
- Nietzsche - "Our vanity, our self love, promotes the cult of genious"
- By calling someone genius is to call them beyond human, something magical. Unexplainable. Doing this puts us in a mode where we become incapable of comparing ourselves with the magical person (we will always see ourselves as being inadequate in comparrison).
- The above is a mythologizing of talent that lets us foregive our own lack of greatness rather than try to achieve the something greater.
- Nietsche implores us all to become craftsmen and acquire genius through seriousness of workmanship
-

p41

- A theory - a theory is an incomplete idea, but it takes what (little data) we have and makes some kind of sense of it in an overly simple way.
- `talent * effort = skill --> skill * effort = achievement`
- "effort makes skill productive"

p44

- MacKenzie the potter produced more and more pots in a day `talent * effort = skill`. Only some out of the ones he produced were good ones.
- MacKenzie the potter over time produced more good pots in a day `skill * effort = achievement`

p45

- John Irving the author spends more time re-reading and re-writing his own work in order to perfect it.

p47

- Runtime on a treadmill is a surprising predictor of psychological adjustment throughout adulthood according to a harvard test conducted of a series of decades.
- effort keeps you on the treadmill longer, not physical fitness

p49

- staying on the treadmill the longest is certainly a feat.
- The true indicator of grit is going back to the treadmill eager to try again the next day.

p50

- if the formula at the top of chapter 3 is correct:
- someone who is twice as talented but half as hardworking as another person might reach the same level of skill but still produce dramatically less over time.
- Strivers improve in skill and quantity of that skill.

p51

- with effort talent becomes skill
- effort makes skill into something productive

# Chapter 4

## How gritty are you?

p54

- "grit isn't just working hard, that's only part of it. there are no shortcuts to excellence."
- grit is about staying with something that you're willing to be loyal to it for a very long time.

p56

- grit has two components passion and perserverence

p59 - 60

- Passion is a compass - look at the example of Jeff Gettlemen pulitzer prize winning journalist who never really knew exactly what he wanted, dispite being a great student (attending oxford university), a great photographer and a great writer. However his passion worked like a compass. Eventually because he kept tinkering and building on what he had already learned it lead him to his ultimate role as journalist and African Bureau chief for the New York Times.

p61

- do you have a life philosophy? ie "This is what I want" Some people have no problem answering this.
- Pete Carroll, head coach of the Seahawks realized he didn't have a life philosophy after being between coaching jobs.
- his? "Do things better than they have been done before"

p62 - p63

- John Wooden (legendary UCLA basketball coach) said that "figuring out the overarching vision is of the utmost importance"
- Envision goals in a hierarchy:

_goal hierarchy:_

```
                Goal                 Top Level - 'The ultimate concern' - Even more abstract and more important.
                 |
        Goal_____|_____Goal          Mid Level - More abstract, more important
        |                |
  Goal__|__Goal    Goal__|__Goal     Low Level - Most concrete and specific goals. Merely a means to an ends
```

p63

- Make everyday choices based around you singular goal or ultimate concern.
- Hall of fame baseball pitcher, Tom Seaver, restructured many very basic aspects of his life (petting dogs with non pitching hand, using non pitching hand in trivially harmful situations, shaping his diet to be more healthy ect) all in order to be a better baseball pitcher.

p64

- _Positive Fantasizing_ is when you have an ultimate concern, but you cannot formulate the smaller goals that get you on the track to reaching that ultimate concern.
- indulging in these fantasies without considering the obstacles are in the way has short term payoffs but long term costs.
- in the short term, not meeting or considering the obstacles will make someone feel good about their aspirations but regret and disappointment later in life when they have failed to reach their goals.
- _Goal conflict_ is when there are multiple competing concerns. This makes it harder to achieve the larger vision of each goal.
- having some competing goals is necessary. For instance there may be a goal hierarchy for being a parent and a professional goal hierarchy.

p66

- Warren Buffett asks his pilot, "don't you have bigger goals than just to fly him around to where he needs to go?"
- Buffett's tip:
  - write down a list of 25 career goals
  - do some soul searching
  - circle only five of them - the highest priority goals
  - avoid the others at all cost. They are the distractions
- like below:

| name of goal   | level of importance (scale from 1-10) | circled? |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| cabinet system | 8                                     | X        |

- if the goals are interrelated, it may not be feasible to circle only five.
- if you have to divide your time between different career goals then you will be in conflict.
- There needs to be one internal compass leading you

p67

- Angela Duckworth adds a step to Buffett's tip: _Ask yourself to what extend do the goals serve a common purpose?_

p74

- Bob Mankoff new yorker cartoonist made getting rejected a sport and faced year over year rejections before finally getting his cartoons published.

p75

- IQ doesn't seem to matter so much when determining the most from the least accomplished people.
- in other words in terms of IQ Sir Isaac Newton was indistinguishable from other lesser known geniuses that accomplished nothing exceedingly memorable.

# chapter 5

## Grit Grows

p79

- is grit more like your height (genetic) or more like the language you speak (learned from experience)?

p80

- (from above) just like most traits, it's a bit of both.

p84

- the previous pages 80 - 83 mostly illustrate how advancement is a function of environmental advancement and nurture. and gives several examples of generational changes that have occured for the better
- Flynn, an academic psychologist calls the "virtuous cycle of skill improvement the social multiplier effect"
- "Small environmental differences or genetic ones can trigger a virtuous cycle"

p85

- so far according to data, previous generations like the greatest generation look to be grittier than todays younger generations.

p86

- it's possible that the generational data showing older people being grittier has more to do with age than with what generation you're from.
- "the maturity principle" - in short we grow up (most of us)
-

p87

- being a promising beginner is fun, but being an actual expert is more gratifying.
- we change when we need to. necessity is the mother of invention and adaptation.

p88 - 89

- "the maturity principle"
- going from diapers to potty training instantaneously (almost). Angela Duckworth's daughter refused to go in the potty until all her classmates in the next grade were (age three)
- Bernie Noe of Lakeside school (in Seattle) daughter was perpetually late for everything until she got her first job, and the manager told her that if she was ever late she would be fired on the spot.
- "lectures don't have the same effect as consequences"

p89

- two truths (probably):
- people do get grittier as the age
- people from other generations may have had to have been more gritty.

p89-90

- how does grit grow in a person?
- the best place to start is to look at where you are now and ask yourself why
- the higher the level of goal the more you will stick with it if you are a true paragon of grit

p91 - 92

- There are some psychological assets / aspects to having grit:
  - interest - you must be totally absorbed by the goal
  - practice - do "it" everyday and focus on re-evaluating and improving day in and day out
  - purpose - purpose makes your interest into a passion
  - hope - perseverance that sticks with you along the way
- the above are all learned traits - that is not exclusively born into.

# Part II: Growing grit from inside out

# Chapter 6

## Interest

p95-97

- do you do what you love? or what is practical?
- people are more satisfied when they do something that matches their personal interests.
- people perform better when they do something they enjoy
-

p99

- matching your job to what captures your attention is a good idea

p100

- not everyone will take a bite of their proverbial sole meuniére and wake up to their passion like Julia Child did.
- Julia admits in her biography that after that meal there was a series of other experiences that played a role in her journey.
- it took Julia 40 years to find her true passion
- Indeed, it can take years to find a passion according to many grit paragons
-

p102

- There is a mythology that a passion comes sudden and swift - career, love or otherwise.
- According to Barry Schwartz of Swarthmore college, exhilarations of a particular subject often only come when sticking with it for the long haul. Only then do the subtleties and nuances start to become truly interesting.
- Meeting a potential match (a promising one) is just the very beginning.
